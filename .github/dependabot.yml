# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# This configuration enables Dependabot to automatically create pull requests
# for security updates and version updates
#
# Note: This repository also has renovate.json configured. If you prefer to use
# only one tool, consider disabling Renovate or removing this file. Both tools
# serve similar purposes but Dependabot is GitHub's native solution with better
# integration for security alerts.
